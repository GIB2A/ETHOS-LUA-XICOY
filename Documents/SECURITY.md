# Security Policy

## Supported versions
This project is currently in beta. If a security-relevant fix is needed, it will be released on the `main` branch and documented in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please avoid publishing a working exploit publicly.

If your organization supports it, use a private reporting channel. Otherwise, contact the maintainer through GitHub and share enough details to reproduce the issue safely.
