# Installation (ETHOS)

## Expected SD card structure
Copy the `GIB2A` folder to your radio SD card so you have:

`SCRIPTS/WIDGETS/GIB2A/main.lua`

Then reboot the radio and add the widget on a screen.

## Troubleshooting
If the widget does not appear:
- check the folder name is exactly `GIB2A`
- verify `main.lua` exists at the expected path
- reboot the radio after copying files
